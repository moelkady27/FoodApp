# Libraries and technologies used

* Navigation Component: One activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activities.
* Retrofit: Making HTTP connections with the REST API and converting meal JSON files to Kotlin/Java objects.
* Room: Save meals in the local database.
* MVVM & LiveData: Separate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
* Coroutines: Perform some code in the background.
* View Binding: Instead of inflating views manually, view binding will take care of that.
* Glide: Cache images and load them in ImageView.
